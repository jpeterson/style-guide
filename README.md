# Gatsby Style Guide Guide

Style Guide Guide is a boilerplate for creating a custom style guide for your organization's design system. It provides just enough IA and hooks to get you going. As a bonus, I've provided links to helpful resources and inspiration to help you as you create your own custom style guide.

[See the demo here](http://bradfrost.github.io/gatsby-style-guide-guide/)

## How it works
Gatsby Style Guide Guide is built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a site generator built with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

The tool can consume and display components from anywhere, but in my own workflow we import patterns from [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) into Style Guide Guide for display. For more info, check out this blog post (coming soon for now).

## Getting Started
1. Download or clone the files from the [repository on Github](https://github.com/bradfrost/gatsby-style-guide-guide).
2. In the command line, navigate to the root of the project and run the `yarn` command. This will download the project dependencies
3. Run `yarn start` to run the project.

From here, obviously the point is to customize the style guide for your needs and populate it with your content and components.

## Importing components and assets from Pattern Lab
